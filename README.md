Query Master
===========
Query Master (QM) is an attempt to create a generic question/query framework that can be used for studying language, math, geography, music theory etc.
QM should work with both a simple and advanced web server. An advanced web server allows login, better sharing of tests, centralized highscores etc.

The client is written using jQuery mobile. The server will use Node.js and Mongo DB primarily but a future port to PHP and MySql is also possible.
